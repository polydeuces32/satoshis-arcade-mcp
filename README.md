## AI Learning System

### Reinforcement Learning
The AI uses a custom reinforcement learning algorithm that:
- **Observes** player behavior patterns
- **Adapts** difficulty based on performance
- **Learns** optimal strategies over time
- **Remembers** context across sessions

### Model Context Protocol (MCP)
- **Memory Layer**: Stores gameplay context and performance data
- **Replay Analysis**: Analyzes successful strategies
- **Cross-Session Learning**: AI remembers you between games
- **Performance Metrics**: Tracks learning progress

## Sound System

### Hard Bass Boom Effects
- **Web Audio API**: Advanced audio synthesis
- **Multiple Oscillators**: Rich, layered bass sounds
- **Deep Frequencies**: 40Hz-200Hz range for maximum impact
- **Distortion & Reverb**: Epic, spacious sound design

### Sound Mapping
- **Hit Sounds**: Punchy paddle impacts
- **Score Sounds**: Deep celebration booms
- **Line Clear**: Epic Tetris completion sounds
- **Level Up**: Victory fanfare with multiple frequencies

## Deployment

### Render.com (Recommended)
1. Connect your GitHub repository to Render
2. The `render.yaml` file will auto-configure deployment
3. Your arcade will be live at `https://your-app.onrender.com`

### Manual Deployment
```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Start production server
uvicorn api.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

## Development

### Adding New Games
1. Create game logic in `api/routes/`
2. Add frontend in `frontend/`
3. Integrate with AI system in `ai/difficulty_agent.py`
4. Update main menu in `frontend/arcade/`

### AI Customization
- Modify `ai/difficulty_agent.py` for different learning algorithms
- Adjust difficulty curves in game routes
- Add new performance metrics to database schema

## Performance Metrics

The AI tracks various metrics:
- **Win/Loss Ratios**: Overall performance
- **Reaction Times**: Player response speed
- **Strategy Patterns**: Common move sequences
- **Difficulty Progression**: Learning curve analysis
